Document 10 - Build System

Introduction:
    Qlib's build system is based on GNUMake. It tracks down dependencies
    automatically with the help of GCC (-MMD) and builds out-source in a
    directory called build. The build system supports two build options
    [release|debug]. The former it's optmized and has it's debug symbols
    stripped, the latter does not.

    The result of a [release|debug] build is the executable (containing the
    app + the library) runnable_app.[release|debug] and a bootable ISO 9660
    image (bootable_app.iso) that bootstraps that executable throguht the
    use of grub.

    The build system is comprised of two files: makefile and makedefs.
    The former provides the rules and the latter provides the definitions.

Bug-Track:
    - clang-format-8: No such file or directory.
    - Build will break if -j is used: Both build options depend on
      test_cli_arguments running before $(BINARY) and $(IMAGE).
