Document 5 - Linker Script

Introduction:
    Each target (currently only i686-elf) that Qlib supports has to have it's
    own dedicated linker script because each system has different boot needs.
    The legacy i386-PC system has to enable the A20 line, setup descriptor
    tables and enter protected mode, whilst cortex-m3-cc2538 has to ...
    Hence the need for different bootloaders. The linker script link.ld is thus
    present at the target specific directory architecture/TARGET.

Bug-Track:
    - Specify cc2538 boot needs.
    - multiboot section not appearing in the first 8k bytes of the executable.
