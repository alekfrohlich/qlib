Document 3 - Utils

Introduction:
    Qlib come's with a set of utilitary abstractions such as OStream and Debug.
    The complete list is comprised of:

    - OStream <ostream.h>: Character output stream for applications. cout is
                           made globally available under qlib's namespace.
    - Debug <debug.h>: Offers a output stream to aid the debugging process of
                       hardware mediators. Can be turned on/off at mediator
                       granularity. Incurs zero-overhead when turned off.
    - Type Traits <traits.h>: Mediator traits and type information.
