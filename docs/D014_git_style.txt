Document 14: Git-style

Introduction:
    New features should be placed on branches of the same name. I.g: the development
    of a keyboard device driver should happen in a branch named `keyboard`. In order
    to commit such implementation into the master branch, all comits must be squashed
    into one big PR commit with a descriptive commit message.

    The PR message should describe what has been done. Details about changes to
    existing modules should appear on the appropriate document.
