Document 4 - crt Stuff

Introduction:
    The C++ programming language relies on external help to produce runnable
    executables that are conformant with the ISOC++ standard. For example, in
    order to properly use objects with static lifetime (declared at namespace
    scope) during program execution, one need's to construct such objects
    before the execution begins.

    This is also true with other features of the language, namely:

    - RTTI
    - Exceptions

    Qlib allows for static objects, but not for RTTI and exceptions. It enables
    such feature by linking crtbegin.o and crtend.o together with the user's app.
    The exact linking order is:

    crt0.o crtend.o [lib objs] [app objs] crtbegin.o

    It prevents undefined symbol errors from dumb linkers.
