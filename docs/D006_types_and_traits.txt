Document 6 - Types and Traits

Introduction:
    Qlib offers applications the oportunity to express their system needs
    through traits. Although the framework is still in it's infancy, it's
    already possible to enable/disable debugging information for each
    individual hardware mediator. As traits become more fine-grained, the
    need for specific type information will arise and then Qlib will offer
    it.
